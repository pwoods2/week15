# Update May 2025:
The code has been updated for the goal of only requiring the following:
1. All-Feature-Main.c (currenly All-Feature-IN-USE-Main.c) 
2. File-Selection.sh - script to process compilation and runs
3. Misc Files - files required for the Feature code to work

# Old Code Format
This is to place all of the week 15 LDA code I have used into one location for better tracking.
Includes:
1. LDA-Input-Files: the Rmd file to create input files
2. input-files: the input files (.txt) created by LDA-Input-Files
3. feature-code: the files (including the compilation script) to compile the input-files into the output-files
4. output-files: the output-files (.txt) used in the annotation-files
5. annotation-files: the files (.R) used to create the calculation-output files
6. calculation-output: the files (.csv) used to sort the data for review and use in the graphics source-files
7. source-files: the files (in grpahics - .m) used to generate figures (.fig)
