# Github Repository created by Phoebe Woods
This is to place all of the week 15 LDA code I have used into one location for better tracking.
Includes:
1. LDA-Input-Files: the Rmd file to create input files
2. annotation-files: the R files to run the LDA for the comparisons
3. calculation-output: the 1-, 2-, and 3-Feature output files
